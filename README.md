# Project FullFrame
Project FullFrame is a mega collection for the most popular web development frameworks. Through developing the same application 10 times in a row, I hope to understand the pros and cons of each framework and provide a comprehensive review of each of them.

## Specifications, Reflections, and Thoughts

### ReactJS
- Version:
    - React: 18.2.0
- Pros:
    - Nice abstraction
    - Easy to transfer knowledge from plain html
    - Very simple Firebase integration
- Cons:
    - Hooks might be counterintuitive at first
    - Routing is done by an external package
    - A lot of unused "test" files initialised
        - `./src` directory is a mess
