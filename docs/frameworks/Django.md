# Django

<p align="center"><b>ðŸš§ FRAMEWORK STILL IN DEVELOPMENT ðŸš§</b></p>

## Initialisation

The commands I used to create initial the project directory.

```bash
python -m pip install Django
django-admin startproject <project-name>
```

The name for the project `django` was not allow dued to it clashing with an existing Python module.

A git repository is automatically created, which could be useful for developers. But for this mega project, I have elected to remove the `.git` directory.

## Thoughts During Development

### First Launch

The command I used to launch the application.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

A local server was start at port `8000`.

## Final Thoughts

## Versions and Details

`Django 5`
