# NextJS

<p align="center"><b>ðŸš§ FRAMEWORK STILL IN DEVELOPMENT ðŸš§</b></p>

## Initialisation

Command I used to create initial the project directory.

```bash
npx create-next-app <project-name>
```

I was prompted with a few creations for further customisation, all of the default values were chosen.

## Thoughts During Development

### First Launch

The command I used to launch the application.

```
npm run dev
```

A local server was start at port `3000`.

`npm run dev` is used as the default launch command for the local development server, which is unique compared to the usual `npm start`.

## Final Thoughts
