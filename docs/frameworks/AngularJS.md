# AngularJS

<p align="center"><b>ðŸš§ FRAMEWORK STILL IN DEVELOPMENT ðŸš§</b></p>

## Initialisation

The command I used to create initial the project directory.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new <project-name>
```

I was prompted with a few creations for further customisation, all of the default values were chosen.

Installation took significantly longer compared to lighter frameworks such as NextJS.

## Thoughts During Development
