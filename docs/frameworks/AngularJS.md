# AngularJS

<p align="center"><b>ðŸš§ FRAMEWORK STILL IN DEVELOPMENT ðŸš§</b></p>

## Initialisation

The command I used to create initial the project directory.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new <project-name>
```

I was prompted with a few creations for further customisation, all of the default values were chosen.

Installation took significantly longer compared to lighter frameworks such as NextJS.

## Thoughts During Development

### First Launch

The command I used to launch the application.

```bash
npm start
```

A local server was start at port `4200`, which is rather unique compared to the usual `3000`, `5000`, or `8000`.

## Final Thoughts

## Versions and Details

`Angular 17.0.0`
