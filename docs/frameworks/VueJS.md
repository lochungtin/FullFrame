# VueJS

<p align="center"><b>ðŸš§ FRAMEWORK STILL IN DEVELOPMENT ðŸš§</b></p>

## Initialisation

The command I used to create initial the project directory.

```bash
npm create-vue <project-name>
cd <project-name>
npm i
```

I was prompted with a few creations for further customisation, all of the default values were chosen.

Unlike other JavaScript based frameworks, except `Svelte`, I have to manually run `npm install` before starting.

## Thoughts During Development

### First Launch

The commands I used to launch the application.

```bash
npm run dev
```

A local server was start at port `5173`, which is rather unique compared to the usual `3000`, `5000`, or `8000`.

## Final Thoughts

## Versions and Details

`Vue 3.3.11`
