# Svelte

<p align="center"><b>🚧 FRAMEWORK STILL IN DEVELOPMENT 🚧</b></p>

## Initialisation

The command I used to create initial the project directory.

```bash
npm create svelte <project-name>
cd <project-name>
npm i
```

I was prompted with a few creations for further customisation, most of the default values were chosen.

Unlike other JavaScript based frameworks, I have to manually run `npm install` before starting.

## Thoughts During Development

### First Launch

The commands I used to launch the application.

```bash
npm run dev
```

A local server was start at port `5173`, which is rather unique compared to the usual `3000`, `5000`, or `8000`.

`npm run dev` is used as the default launch command for the local development server, which is unique compared to the usual `npm start`.

## Final Thoughts
