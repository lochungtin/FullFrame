# RemixJS

<p align="center"><b>ðŸš§ FRAMEWORK STILL IN DEVELOPMENT ðŸš§</b></p>

## Initialisation

The command I used to create initial the project directory.

```bash
npx create-remix <project-name>
```

I was prompted with a few creations for further customisation, most of the default values were chosen.

Unlike django, I was able to choose if a `git` repository is created for me.

## Thoughts During Development

### First Launch

The commands I used to launch the application.

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

A local server was start at port `3000`.

`npm run build` must be ran before `npm start`, which is one extra command compared to other frameworks.

## Final Thoughts

## Versions and Details

`Remix 2.4.1`
